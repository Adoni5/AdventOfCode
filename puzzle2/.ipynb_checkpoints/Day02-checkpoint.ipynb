    "\n",
    "Outside the utility closet, you hear footsteps and a voice. \"...I'm not sure either. But now that so many people have chimneys, maybe he could sneak in that way?\" Another voice responds, \"Actually, we've been working on a new kind of suit that would let him fit through tight spaces like that. But, I heard that a few days ago, they lost the prototype fabric, the design plans, everything! Nobody on the team can even seem to remember important details of the project!\"\n",

    "To make sure you didn't miss any, you scan the likely candidate boxes again, counting the number that have an ID containing exactly two of any letter and then separately counting those with exactly three of any letter. You can multiply those two counts together to get a rudimentary checksum and compare it to what your device predicts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " - `abcdef contains no letters that appear exactly two or three times.`\n",
    " - `bababc contains two a and three b, so it counts for both.`\n",
    " - `abbcde contains two b, but no letter appears exactly three times.`\n",
    " - `abcccd contains three c, but no letter appears exactly two times.`\n",
    " - `aabcdd contains two a and two d, but it only counts once.`\n",
    " - `abcdee contains two e.`\n",
    " - `ababab contains three a and three b, but it only counts once.`\n",
